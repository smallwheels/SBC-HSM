# SBC-HSM
# Coventry University - Ethical Hacking and Cyber Security (Bsc) Final Year Project
Hardware Security Modules (HSM) are commonly used to increase data security by containing a number of cryptographic functions (such as encryption / decryption) in a separate physical computing device that can be hardened and tamper resistant.

This project will be investigating the functionality necessary to create a HSM using SBCs (e.g. generating cryptographic material) and does not aim to review the efficacy of any given SBC security or system hardening, however this may be taken as a consideration when selecting OS or hardware through secondary research.
